## Running the stack:

First, clone this repo. If you don't have access to a Spot, you can still demo the entire frontend and AI part of the app locally, as long as you provide your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.

### backend
1. install Poetry
2. `poetry install`
3. `poetry run dev` to start the backend

### frontend
1. install Bun
2. `bun install`
3. `bun dev` to start the frontend

### robot server
1. connect to Spot's wifi network
2. run `python3 python/examples/wasd_server/app.py` and replace the hostname `192.168.80.3` with your Spot's IP
3. enter the `admin` username & password, or the equivalent credentials for your Spot
4. send requests to control endpoints manually or via the frontend
